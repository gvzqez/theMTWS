# theMTWS
First project of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

It consist on a python generated html webpage that allows visitors to review movies' trailers and ratings for different movie sections.
The movie data is provided through **themoviedb.org** API using the python library **pytmdb3**.
(See documentation: https://github.com/wagnerrp/pytmdb3)

### Note:
API requests are limited to 30 within 10 seconds, so the first time the programme is executed, it will take a few more time before the page is displayed. Then, the data is stored in the local cache for one hour.
