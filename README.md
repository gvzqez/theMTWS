# theMTWS
First project of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

It consist on a python generated html responsive webpage that allows visitors to review movies' trailers and ratings for different movie sections. The movie data is provided through **themoviedb.org** API using the python library **pytmdb3**.<br />
<br />
(See documentation: https://github.com/wagnerrp/pytmdb3)
<br />
#### Note:
API requests are limited to 30 within 10 seconds, so the first time the programme is executed, it will take a few more time before the page is displayed. Then, the data is stored in the local cache for one hour. <br />

<br />

## How to open the Movie Trailer Website

The only requirement is to have **Python 2.7** installed:<br />
```
$ git clone https://github.com/gvzqez/theMTWS
$ cd theMTWS
$ python main.py
```
